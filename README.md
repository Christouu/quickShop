Quick Shop

Quick Shop is an ecommerce website for 24/7 shops all around Sofia. You can view the company's products and see all our shops around the city.
You can browse all our products with out making an account. If you make an account you can save your favourite products or give a comment below products.
There is an admin page for admin accounts and have access to the admin page. From there you can see you monthly income, monthly sales, manage products, users and orders of your clients. As an admin you can delete , update or add products. You can manage orders to be completed or not. You have the ability to manage users accounts if needed.

For the Front-end I am using:
  - React
  - React-circular-progressbar
  - Redux/Redux Toolkit
  - Redux-persist
  - Styled-components
  - TypeScript
  - React Testing Library
  - Material-ui-chip-input
  - Mock Service Worker

For the Back-end I am using:
  - TypeScript
  - Node.js
  - Crypto-js
  - Dotenv
  - Epxress
  - JSON Web Token
  - Mongoose
  
This project will be upgraded in the near future like :
  - Profile page for users to save their favourite products, user information, profile picture, transaction history.
  - Comment section under products so that users write their opinions on products (Google comments or handmade comments section).
  - Newsfeed page from the company to advertise new products or when products are on sale.
  - Admin page needs pages for monthly income information, monthly sales, profit information for the  company easily manage money.
  - Admin page for updating products. Changing their information and picture (going to use firebase for img storage).
  - Admin page for orders. Completed or not. Information for user order and if the order is going to be delevired by company (like Takeaway).
  - Google maps for location of the shops.
  - The website is mobile responsive, but isn't tablet or different types of monitor size responsive.
  - Some components and functionality have tests, but not all of them. Going to make tests for everything.
  - Cypress tests.
  - Some types have 'any' for them so that the website can works. Going to change every type to have specific interfaces like it should be.
  - This website is made with React. After all of the above features are done this project might be made again but in Angular, RxJS and NgRx.
